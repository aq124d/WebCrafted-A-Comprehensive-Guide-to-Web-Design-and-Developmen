        <!-- Explanation of the introduction content -->
        <p>Data packets must be addressed and routed according to a set of guidelines known as the Internet Protocol (IP) in order for them to pass through networks and reach their intended location.
        The tiny units of data that travel across the Internet are referred to as packets. 
        Every packet has IP information attached to it, which routers use to direct packets to the appropriate location. 
        Data is sent to the required location when packets are routed to the IP address associated with each device or domain that connects to the Internet.<br>
        Depending on whatever transport protocol is used with IP, the packets are treated differently once they reach their destination. TCP and UDP are the most used transport protocols.[11]</p>

           <!-- Explanation of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) -->
        <p>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a communications standard that enables application programs and computing devices to exchange messages over a network. It is designed to send packets across the internet and ensure the successful delivery of data and messages over networks.
        TCP is one of the basic standards that define the rules of the internet
        TCP organizes data so that it can be transmitted between a server and a client. It guarantees the integrity of the data being communicated over a network. Before it transmits data, TCP establishes a connection between a source and its destination, which it ensures remains live 
        until communication begins. It then breaks large amounts of data into smaller packets, while ensuring data integrity is in place throughout the process.        
        There are three phases of TCP 3-way handshake. So, what are the three phases of tcp three-way handshake? These phases (messages) are given below: </p>
        <!-- List of TCP handshake phases -->
        <ul>
            <li>SYN</li>
            <li>SYN ACK</li>
            <li> ACK</li>
        </ul>  
                
        <p>There are 9 bits flags area in TCP Header. Here, the SYN and ACK bits in the TCP Header are set to 0 or 1 according to the message. </p>
        <!-- Explanation of TCP 3-way handshake phases -->
        <ul>
            <li><strong><span style="color: #00f0ff;">SYN (Synchronize Sequence Number):</span></strong> Firstly, the client sends SYN (Synchronize Sequence Number) message. This means that “I would like 
                to start a TCP session with this sequence number!” After sending SYN, clients wait for a reply from the server. </li>
            <li><strong><span style="color: #00f0ff;">SYN ACK message: </span> </strong> The server gets SYN message and replies with SYN ACK message. With this message it says that “This sequence number is OK for me!” </li>
            <li><strong><span style="color: #00f0ff;">ACK message: </span></strong>Lastly, the client sends ACK message and they establish a reliable connection for data transfer with this TCP handshaking mechanism.[7]</li>
        </ul><br>
        
        <h3> ‣ UDP(User Datagram Protocal)</h3>
        <img src="assets/media/img4.jpg" alt="int">
         <!-- Explanation of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) -->
        <p>A common communication protocol on the Internet for time-sensitive transfers like DNS lookups and video playing is called User Datagram Protocol,
            or UDP. By transferring data without first formally establishing a link, it speeds up communications. This makes it possible for data to be sent very fast, but it can also lead to packet loss in transit, 
            which can be exploited by DDoS assaults.</p>
             <!-- Further explanation of UDP -->
        <p>Transmissions with UDP bypass the TCP protocol. Alternatively, one computer might just start transmitting data to the other.
            Data may be transferred significantly more quickly via UDP than over TCP since
             it doesn't require a "handshake" or a check to see if the data arrived correctly.
             This speed does, however, come with costs. A UDP datagram cannot be resent if it is lost in transit. 
             Applications using UDP thus need to be able to withstand loss, duplication, and mistakes.[10] </p>
