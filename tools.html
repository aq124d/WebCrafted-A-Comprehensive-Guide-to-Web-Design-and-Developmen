        <h3>What should you look for in Web Design Tools?</h3>
        There are 5 main features you should be looking at:<ol>
            <li>Templates: The first is the accessibility of ready-made templates that don't require highly developed web design knowledge. A tool with enough templates will make things easier for you 
            to get started and offer you an idea of how your website will look in the end.[13]</li>
            <li>Customization: Customization is another thing you should be on the lookout for. With the help of this tool, your design team can modify the website to better suit your demands. Customization makes sure that your website doesn't 
            the same design as those of your rivals. It is simpler to work on your visual identity and brand recognition when there are customization features available.[13]</li>
            <li>Integrations: You also want a site designer tool that integrates with systems. It will be simpler to import fresh content into your website without sacerificing its efficiency if the tool is compatible with the content management 
            system you now use.[13]</li>
            <li>Options: Furthermore, keep an eye out for web design tools that provide a plethora of possibilities for graphics and fonts. This is so that you can employ typography to give your website a unique visual charater. 
            It's somewhat easier to show your style and potentially make a statement when you have lots of possibilities.[13]</li>
            <li>Interface: Lastly, a web design tool with an intuitive yet robust UI is what you want. Instead of wasting endless hours trying to figure out how the tool works, the latter option spares you a great deal of problems and workarounds,
            allowing you to concentrate entirely on the website design.[13]</li>
